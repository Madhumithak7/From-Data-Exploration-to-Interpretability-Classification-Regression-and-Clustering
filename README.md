# From Data to Decision: A Holistic Approach to Classification, Regression, and Clustering"
## Datasets:
### Regression - Diamond Prices:

Dataset: diamonds.csv
Variable to be Predict Y= “Price”

### Classification - IBM_HR_analytics and employee attrition:

Dataset: HR_comma_sep.csv
Variable to be Predict Y= “Left”

### Tasks:
1) Data Pre-processing
2) Data Analysis with 4 models, Hyperparameter tunning, Grid search
       - Regression [Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, SVM Regression, KNN Regression]
       - Classification [Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, SVM Classification, KNN Classification]
3) K-Fold Cross Validation
4) Data Analysis with 4 different model and compare 8 models
       - Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM
5) Plotly Library to plot and find out best model with high accuracy
6) Create Dashboard for three best- performed regression model [Drop box, Multiple Select, RMSE]
7) Prediction with Neutral Networks
       - Pre-processing
       - Find optimal training time
       - Present Performance result with 3 best architectures
       - 5 fold cross-validation
6) Feature importance evaluated
7) LIME method for locally calculate feature importance
8) Partial Dependence Plot for each features for Best NN model

### Dimentionality Reduction
### Tasks:
1) PDP plot
2) tSNE Plot

### Cluster Analysis
### Tasks:
1) K-means Clustering
2) Hierarchical Clustering
3) DBScan Clustering
4) Reduced Dataset Clustering
